- 🏆 I'm currently finished learning:
   - **Pascal** *(University requirement. Learned the basis for comfortable work in the future)*
- 🚧 I'm contributed in:
   - [**ru.javascript.info**](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/ru.javascript.info) - Fixed a broken link, nothing else :(
      - PR: https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/ru.javascript.info/pull/733

- 🛠 I'm currently have such projects *(Projects are arranged in chronological order)*:
  - **Main Projects:**
     - [**Project Aether**](https://secondthunder.github.io) — My personal landing page, written on pure HTML/CSS/JS *(Planning to move on React.js :D)*
     - ***{Archived}*** [**Scroball X**](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/Scroball-X) — Fork of [Scroball](https://github.com/peterjosling/scroball) by Peter Josling, where I made some changes to provide Google-like Material UI, Adless UX, Dark Theme and many other visual improvements
     - [**DokiDoki-RenPy**](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/DokiDoki-RenPy) — Decompile of Doki Doki Literature Club for internal use in RenPy Launcher, e.g. modification or self-learning *(Because code of DDLC's minigames and "glitches" is awesome, even in our time)*
       - But, there are a lot of repositories with decompiled code of this game, what is the advantage of your repository?
         - To begin with, I organized the necessary files and deleted unnecessary folders that are not used when interacting with the game in RenPy
         - The code was formatted for best readability when editing
         - And...here's a pretty nice README ;)
     - [**Project Odysseus**](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/project-odysseus) — Some random bot for Discord which was created just for fun and for some educational purposes *(Made with Discord.py library)*
     - [**Webhook-Notifier**](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/Webhook-Notifier) - Simple Python script for posting to Discord *(Written as submodule for main bot)*
     - ***{Postponed}*** [**Namegen**](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/namegen-public) - Python script to get a random "person" using a random name and brand name. Made as a result of one joke in the local chat ...
  - **Figma Projects:**
    - ***{Archived}*** [**OrbitReader**](https://www.figma.com/file/GsnLhc0IVJnofPt6yw3JZW/Orbit) — A quick sketch for one unreleased app
    - ***{Postponed}*** [**Project Delta**](https://www.figma.com/file/Sk8zK5CWB7XjqRE0Uq5T04/Project-Delta) — Sketch and ideas for interesting player design
