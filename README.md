<details><summary><strong>Some info about my activity</strong></summary><p>

- 🔭 I’m currently not working on any projects
- 📚 I'm currently learning:
  - **Python** *(Great language to start with)*
  - **JavaScript + Node.js** *(Currently for building powerful bot for Discord)*
  - **Pascal** *(Not a personal choice, but my university requirement)*
- ⌛ Currently set on hold
  - **C++** *(Was impressed by the flexibility and nativeness of the language)*
  - **SQL** *(It will never be superfluous to manage databases)*
- 🌱 I’m want to learn in future:
  - **HTML + CSS (Intermediate)** *(Mostly for quickly creating great websites)*
  - **JavaScript Things**
    - **TypeScript** *(To enhance JavaScript power)*
    - **Electron, React, Angular.js, Vue** *(For making something interesting)*
  - **Ren'Py** *(Yep, I was inspired by DDLC in 2020 -_- and want to create some VN)*
- 🛠 I'm currently have such projects:
  - [**Scroball X**](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/Scroball-X) — Fork of [Scroball](https://github.com/peterjosling/scroball) by Peter Josling, where I made some changes to provide Material Theme 2, Adless UI, Dark Theme and many other visual improvements
  - [**DokiDoki-RenPy**](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/DokiDoki-RenPy) — Decompile of Doki Doki Literature Club for internal use in RenPy Launcher, e.g. modification or self-learning *(Because code of DDLC is awesome, even in our time)*
    - But, in the vastness of Github is full of decompiled code of this game, what is the advantage of your repository?
      - To begin with, I organized the necessary files and deleted unnecessary folders that are not used when interacting with the game in RenPy
      - The code was formatted for best readability when editing
      - And...here's a pretty nice README ;)
  - [**secondthunder-js-bot**](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/secondthunder-js-bot) — Some random bot for Discord which was created just for fun and for some educational purposes *(Made with Discord.js library)*
  - [**My Landing Page**](https://secondthunder.github.io) — Despite the fact that the site is ready, I am constantly adding something new and interesting
  - **Figma Projects:**
    - [**OrbitReader**](https://www.figma.com/file/GsnLhc0IVJnofPt6yw3JZW/Orbit) — A quick sketch for one unreleased app
    - [**Project Delta**](https://www.figma.com/file/Sk8zK5CWB7XjqRE0Uq5T04/Project-Delta?node-id=7%3A3917) — Sketch and ideas for interesting player design
